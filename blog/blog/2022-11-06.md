# **Why you should be creating content**

The internet is a powerful place.

You can send anyone on with a Linkedin or a Twitter account a message, no matter where they are located.

The connectivity that these social channels allow you to tap into is insane.

Beyond messaging people on a 1:1 basis, you can create a platform to spread your message and develop your brand.

Over the last 3 months, my content on Linkedin has been seen over 265,561 times and I gained 3,043 followers.

But, you can't take likes and views to the bank.

The real benefit of creating content is that it has opened doors to job opportunities, connecting with people, and developing a brand as a software engineer.

So, I am going to break down my entire process.

## Asymmetric advantages

### Advantages

* One of the best ways to learn is to teach, and that is exactly what you're doing while creating content on a topic
* Create an audience of fans supporting you
* Create a sense of community
* Opens doors for new opportunities
* Develop your brand

### Disadvantages

Literally nothing....


## The Different social channels (Linkedin, Twitter, Youtube, TikTok)

I am going to break down the social channels that I use and my experience with them, your mileage may vary.

### Linkedin

Linkedin is my primary social channel.

Linkedin is a great place to start out because of the amount of recruiters and other business connections you can make.

### Twitter

I am building my twitter channel more seriously now.

Twitter is a great place to connect with other software engineers.

It is more casual than Linkedin, but you will find some of the brightest minds going back and forth with interesting discussions.

### Youtube

Youtube is great especially for explaining techncial topics since you have the visual aspect of video which can be a visual aid.


### TikTok

TikTok is something that I am experementing with.

I find the platform extremely interesting, plus when Chris Walker from Refine Labs says he is going all in on the platform, you can't help but to take notice.

I think that the most interesting part of TikTok is that the whole algorithim is interest based.

Unlike other platforms where you have to follow a person to see their content, TikTok's algorithm takes what you are searching for and watching, and displays similiar videos.


## What to share & How to share it

### What to share

I have experiemented with mutliple different styles of content on these social channels.

Long form and technical, short and technical, short and motivational, long and personal.

From my experience, content that is short form and stays out of the weeds performs the best.

So you're probably asking "How am I going to show off my technical knowledge?"

Well, that is where your blog comes in, but i'll touch on that in the next section.

### The next step 

Push all short form social content to long form content like blog posts, podcasts, in depth youtube videos.

This is where you go down the rabbit holes and show how you articulate technical topics clearly.

## The systems to power your content machine

### Templates

The biggest obstacle to vercome when you're creating content, is getting past the blank screen.

Thats where templates come in.

With well constructed templates, your content can essentially become plug n play.

Another benefit of these templates is that you can rapidly produce your cotnent.

### Create a content schedule

Having a content scheudle will help you stay accountable, organized, and help build out a content strategy.

for example here is my content schedule.

Monday - Educational content

Tuesday - Tear-down content

Wednesday - A success story

Thursday - Tear-down content

Friday - Content about interveiwing

Saturday - Primer for my newsletter

Sunday - a post newsletter call to action 


### Tools

Use tools like HypeFury to schedule your content across multiple different platforms.
