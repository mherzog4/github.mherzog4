**Issue #08: Content Systems for Software Engineers** Nov 6, 2022

Agenda:

- Start with why
- Asymmetric advantages
- The different social channels (Linkedin, Twitter, Youtube, TikTok, Twitch)
- What to share & How to share it
- The systems to power your content machine
- My results

Let’s jump in.

# Why you should be creating content
The connectivity that social channels allow you to tap into is insane.

Beyond messaging people on a 1:1 basis, you can leverage the social channel platform to spread your message and develop your brand.

Over the last 3 months, my content on Linkedin has been seen over 265,561 times and I gained 3,043 followers.

But, you can’t take likes and views to the bank.

The real benefit of creating content is that it has helped me open doors to job opportunities, connecting with people, and developing my brand as a software engineer.

So, I am going to break down my entire process.

# Asymmetric advantages
## Advantages
- One of the best ways to learn is to teach, and that is exactly what you’re doing while creating content on a topic.

- Create an audience of fans supporting you

- Create a community

- Opens doors for new opportunities
Develop your brand
## Disadvantages
There is a good chance you'll struggle in the beginning.

Finding your voice, battling imposter syndrome, having writer's block, the "resistance" etc.

These are all things that you will encounter, but, in a later section, we will talk about tools and tricks to help combat those obstacles.

Another disadvantage is that you won’t see much growth, or money, in the early stages.

But, if you can make it work, it’s genuinely life-changing.

# The Different social channels (Linkedin, Twitter, Youtube, TikTok)
I am going to break down the social channels that I use and my experience with them, your mileage may vary.

## Linkedin
Linkedin is my primary social channel.

Linkedin is a great place to start out because of the large number of recruiters and other business connections you can make.

## Twitter
I am building my twitter channel more seriously now.

Twitter is a great place to connect with other software engineers.

It is more casual than Linkedin, but you will find some of the brightest minds going back and forth with interesting discussions.

## Youtube
Youtube is great for explaining technical topics since you have the visual aid of video.

So far I have broken down Leetcode problems, but I have plans for more in depth content like tutorials, live coding projects, interviews, and more.

## TikTok
TikTok is something that I am experimenting with.

I find the platform extremely interesting, plus when Chris Walker from Refine Labs says he is going all in on the platform, you can’t help but take notice.

I think that the most interesting part of TikTok is that the whole algorithm is interest based.

Unlike other platforms where you have to follow a person to see their content, TikTok’s algorithm takes what you are searching for and watching, and displays similar videos.

So far, I have cross-posted my Youtube videos onto my TikTok channel, but I have plans for short form content covering specific topics.

# What to share & How to share it
## What to share
I have experimented with multiple different styles of content on these social channels.

Long form and technical, short and technical, short and motivational, long and personal.

From my experience, content that is short form and stays out of the weeds performs the best.

So you’re probably asking “How am I going to show off my technical knowledge?”

Well, that is where your blog comes in, but I’ll touch on that in the next section.

## How to share
In my experience, framing content in a first person point of view helps with battling imposter syndrome.

By framing my content this way, I can share my unique voice because all of my experiences are unique to me.

This is important to stand out from the noise that is on social channels.

## The next step
Push all short form social content to long form content like blog posts, podcasts, in depth youtube videos.

This is where you go down the rabbit holes and show how you articulate technical topics clearly.

# The systems to power your content machine
## Templates
The biggest obstacle to overcome when you’re creating content, is getting past the blank screen.

That's where templates come in.

With well constructed templates, your content can essentially become plug n play.

Another benefit of these templates is that you can rapidly produce your content.

## Create a content schedule
Having a content schedule will help you be accountable, stay organized, and help build out a content strategy.

for example here is my content schedule.

Monday - Educational content

Tuesday - Tear-down content

Wednesday - A success story

Thursday - Tear-down content

Friday - Content about interviewing

Saturday - Primer for my newsletter

Sunday - a post newsletter call to action

## Tools

# My results
Here is a list of screenshots of messages that I have received that is directly correlated to my content creation on Linkedin.

Hopefully, if you're on the fence about starting to create your own content, this will push you over the edge and give it a shot.
