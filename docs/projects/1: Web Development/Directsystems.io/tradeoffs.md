# Trade-offs

## Next.js

I decided to use Next instead of React because of the ecosystem that is around Next.js

Next is a framework that sits on top of React and recently had a big upgrade.

Using Next instead of React provided some extra functionality that with react would have taken more boilerplate code.

## Tailwind

I decided to use Tailwind instead of vanilla CSS or other CSS libraryies/frameworks because I haven't use the tool before and figured this would be a great intro.

To me, Tailwind provides a very simple way to edit css by editing classnames within the component file.

My favorite part of this is the reduction of context switching back and forth between different files.

## Vite

Vite is a build tool that provides Hot-Module-Refreshing among many other features.

It seems like a lot of the developer community is moving away from Create-React-App and moving to more modern tools like Vite.


## Testing

I utilized Jest for Unit tests and Cypress for End-to-End testing

Jest seems to go hand in hand with React and Cypress is also popular within the ecosystem.

In future projects, I would consider using Playwrite by Microsoft to compare and contrast the performance and developer experience.

Blog comming soon!

## Deployment

I deployed the website using Vercel.

I love pretty much everything by Vercel, they make the developer experience amazing.
