# Why?

I wanted a clean and simple marketing website for my consulting/freelance company that I could code and deploy within a day, 2 days max.

## Problem

I was using the no-code platform carrd, but I felt like functionality and design was limited.

## Solution

Code the website by using modern tools that speed up development.

## What I wanted to learn

- How to use Tailwind
- Explore the Vercel ecosystem
- How to write efficient tests using different tools
- Move away from CRA and into the Vite ecosystem.
