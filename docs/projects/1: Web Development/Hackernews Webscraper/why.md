# Why?

## Problem

I have seen many uses cases for web scraping, so I wanted to have an intro to this tool to build more complex scraping features in the future.

## Solution

Utilize the Python library BeautifulSoup to scrape the Hackernews website to display data within the CLI environment.

## What I wanted to learn

- Web scraping
- Python syntax and functionality
- BeautifulSoup
