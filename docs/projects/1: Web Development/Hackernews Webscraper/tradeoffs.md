# Trade-offs

## BeautifulSoup

I decided to use BeatufulSoup over tools like Puppeteer because BeatifulSoup seems like to go to library for developing web scraping functionality with Python.

## Python

I decided to use Python instead of JavaScript/Node to gain familiarity with Python's functionality and syntax since my coding bootcamp didn't touch Python.
