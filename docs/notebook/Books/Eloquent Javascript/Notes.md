## Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators

Bits are any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zeros and ones.

Any piece of discrete information can be reduced to a sequence of zeors and ones and thus represented in bits

### Values

Every value has a type that determines its role. 

Some values are numbers, some values are pieces of some text, and some are functions, ect

To create a value, you must merely invoke its name

### Numbers

Values of the number type are numeric values

### Strings

Strings are used to represent text

You can use single, double quotes, or Backticks to mark the strings, as long as the quotes at the start and the end of the string match

### Unary Operators

Not all operators are symbols, some are written as words

one example is using the typeof operator

console.log(typeof "abc")
// -> string

### Boolean Values

A value that distringuishes between only two possibilities like "true" or "false" or "yes" or "no"

console.log(1 > 2)
// false
